# POWER-BI-COGNIFYZ-INTERNSHIP-PROJECT
INTERNSHIP PROJECT OF POWER BI
ðŸ”·INVESTMENT ANALYSIS POWER BI DASHBOARD
âœ… Project Objective - Developed an interactive dashboard using investments and savings data from a Excel datasheet, to provide real-time insights. Streamlined data processing & analysis with visualisation to monitor key performance metrics and trends. Shared actionable insights based on dashboard findings to support decision-making processes.

âœ… KEY PERFORMANCE & INSIGHTS 

ðŸ”ºTask-1: Data Exploration and Summary Power BI dashboard:
1.	Primary Savings Objective: Retirement Planning is the top savings goal, followed by Healthcare and Education, indicating a strong focus on long-term financial security.
2.	Investment Avenues by Age Contribution:	Mutual Funds account for the largest share of total age sum, implying they are the most preferred investment avenue among a relatively older group of users.
3.	Objective-wise Gender Count: Capital Appreciation dominates as the primary objective across genders, followed by Growth, while Income is the least common goal.
4.	Demographic Overview: The average investor age remains 28, reflecting a youthful audience actively engaging in long-term financial planning.
   

ðŸ”ºTask-2: Gender-based Analysis Power BI dashboard:
1.	Male Investors Lead Participation: The dataset shows 25 male and 15 female investors, indicating a significant gender gap. Males are more actively participating in various investment avenues compared to females.
2.	Gender-wise Investment Preferences: Males show higher investment volumes in Mutual Funds, Debentures, and Government Bonds, especially in the 25â€“30 age group. This suggests they are more inclined toward medium- to long-term financial instruments.
Females, while fewer in number, demonstrate more balanced participation across Fixed Deposits, Equity Markets, and Government Bonds.
3.	Equity and Mutual Fund Trends:	Equity Market and Mutual Fund investments peak among males aged around 28â€“30, showing high engagement and possibly greater risk appetite at that age range.
Females show a steady but lower engagement in both markets, possibly reflecting conservative or diversified strategies.
4.	PPF and Fixed Deposits Participation: PPF (Public Provident Fund) and Fixed Deposits see modest engagement from both genders, but males again dominate in count and sum, emphasizing their broader participation across all instruments.


ðŸ”ºTask-3: Objective Analysis Power BI dashboard:
1.	Female-Dominated Investment Objectives:
Across all savings objectivesâ€”Education, Health Care, and Retirement Planâ€”female investors are consistently the primary participants, especially in Mutual Funds and Fixed Deposits.
2.	Avenue Preferences by Objective: Mutual Funds are the most preferred investment avenue across all objectives.
Health Care sees diversified investments across all avenues including PPF and Equity, suggesting more varied financial planning for this goal.
3.	Age Trends by Objective: Retirement Planning has the highest average age (~30+), indicating older investors prioritize it.
Education shows the lowest average age group (~mid-20s), aligning with younger investors planning ahead.


ðŸ”ºTask-4: Investment Duration and Frequency Power BI dashboard:
1.	Gender-based Investment Monitoring: Females are more active in daily and monthly investment monitoring across all avenues (Equity, FD, Mutual Fund, PPF).
Males are more involved in weekly monitoring, particularly in Equity.
2.	Investment Duration Preferences: The average age increases with investment duration: investors aged 30+ tend to invest for 3â€“5 years, while younger investors prefer durations under 1 year.
Few investors commit to durations beyond 5 years, indicating a short- to medium-term investment mindset.


ðŸ”ºTask-5: Reasons for Investment Power BI dashboard:
1.	Gender-based Investment Motives: Males dominate investment decisions across all avenues (Equity, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and FDs), especially for reasons like Tax Benefits, Safe Investment, and Fund Diversification.
Females show a balanced presence in motives such as Liquidity (Equity), High Interest Returns (FD), and Better Returns (Mutual Funds), indicating a more return-oriented approach.
2.	Duration-wise Investment Reasons: Shorter durations (1â€“3 years) attract the most investments across all reasons and avenues.
For Equity, reasons like Capital Appreciation and Dividends are popular in mid-term (1â€“3 years), while Liquidity is relevant in shorter terms.
Risk-Free and Fixed Returns dominate FD motives for mid-term investors, whereas Tax Benefits drive Mutual Fund choices primarily for the same duration.


ðŸ”ºTask-6: Source of Information Power BI dashboard:
1.	Gender Influence on Information Sources: Males heavily rely on traditional sources like Financial Consultants, Newspapers, and Television.
Females show a strong preference for Internet as their primary investment information source.
2.	Age Trends by Source and Avenue: Investors using Television and Internet tend to be younger across all investment avenues.
Public Provident Fund (PPF) and Mutual Fund users get most of their information from Internet and Newspapers, while Equity investors are guided more by Financial Consultants and Magazines.



ðŸ”ºTASK-7:Investment Analysis Report Power BI dashboard:
1.	Investor Demographics: The average age of investors is 28 years, indicating a young investor base.
Gender distribution is skewed, with 25 males compared to only 15 females, suggesting lower participation of women in investment activities.
2.	Investment Purpose Analysis: The most common reason for investing is Returns (34.82%), followed closely by Wealth Creation (33.27%) and Savings for Future (31.91%).
This shows a fairly even spread in investment motivation but with a slight preference for short- to mid-term returns.
3.	Savings Objectives by Gender: Males are more engaged across all savings objectivesâ€”Retirement, Healthcare, and Education.
This suggests men are more proactive in long-term and purpose-driven financial planning compared to women.
4.	Investment Avenue Preferences: Equity and Mutual Funds dominate short- to medium-term investment preferences (1â€“5 years).
Fixed Deposits and Public Provident Funds (PPF) are associated with more conservative strategies and longer durations.
5.	Monitoring Frequency vs Avenue: Investors who monitor their portfolios daily tend to prefer Mutual Funds and Equity, indicating active management and higher involvement.
Weekly or monthly monitoring aligns more with traditional instruments like Fixed Deposits and PPF.
6.	Age-wise Purpose Distribution: Investors aiming for Returns tend to be slightly older (avg. 30 years), while those focused on Savings for Future are younger (avg. 27.5 years).
Wealth creation is popular among a wide age range, indicating it as a universal investment goal.
7.	Investment Objective by Duration: Capital Appreciation is more commonly associated with long-term durations (5+ years).
Growth and Income objectives are pursued across various time spans, showing flexibility in investment behavior.
